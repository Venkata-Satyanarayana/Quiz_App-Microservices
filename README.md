ðŸ§  Multi-User Quiz Microservices Application
ðŸ“˜ Description
This is a Spring Boot microservices-based quiz application designed for multiple users to register, log in, generate quizzes, and attempt questions. Each userâ€™s quiz data (including AI-generated questions) is isolated, ensuring privacy and individual tracking.

The system is broken down into microservices with Spring Cloud, supports RESTful APIs, uses Eureka for service discovery, and integrates Spring AI with Ollamaâ€™s Gemma 2B model for generating quiz questions.
